=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Convex POC - Real-time React Application with Self-Hosted Database
Workspace: /Users/wharsojo/dev/convex-poc2
Started: 2026-01-14

Session 2 (Subtask Implementation):
- Subtask 1-2: Installed Convex dependencies and React Router
  * Added convex@^1.18.3 to package.json
  * Added react-router-dom@^7.1.1 to package.json
  * Committed changes with git

=== END SESSION 2 ===

Session 3 (Subtask Implementation):
- Subtask 2-2: Created Python deployment orchestration script
  * Created scripts/deploy.py with docker-compose orchestration
  * Implemented up/down/logs/status commands with health check loop
  * Added proper error handling with subprocess.run and check=True
  * Included graceful handling when requests library is unavailable
  * Created comprehensive help documentation with argparse
  * Added user-friendly output with status indicators (✓, ✗, ⚠)
  * Committed changes with git

=== END SESSION 3 ===

Session 4 (Subtask Implementation):
- Subtask 3-1: Created Convex schema with mock data model
  * Created convex/schema.ts with mockData table definition
  * Defined fields: name (string), value (number), description (optional string)
  * Used defineSchema and defineTable from "convex/server"
  * Used validators from "convex/values" (v)
  * Added comprehensive documentation with references to Convex docs
  * Schema follows patterns from https://docs.convex.dev/home and https://stack.convex.dev/end-to-end-ts
  * Committed changes with git

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a greenfield project creating new functionality from scratch. We're building a complete application (React frontend + Convex backend + Docker deployment) with specific features (real-time sync, CRUD interface) that don't exist yet. The feature workflow is appropriate because we have multiple services with clear dependencies: backend must be deployed before frontend can consume APIs, and integration phase ties everything together.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json with 9 phases, 17 subtasks
- Created/updated project_index.json with service definitions
- Created/updated context.json with patterns and external references
- Created init.sh setup script
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Project Setup): 3 subtasks, depends on []
  - Initialize Vite + React project
  - Install Convex dependencies and React Router
  - Create basic project directory structure

- Phase 2 (Infrastructure Setup): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-1-setup]
  - Create Docker Compose configuration for Convex backend
  - Create Python deployment orchestration script
  - Create environment variable template file

- Phase 3 (Backend - Schema Definition): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-1-setup]
  - Create Convex schema with mock data model

- Phase 4 (Backend - Functions): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-3-backend-schema]
  - Create query function to retrieve mock data
  - Create mutation function to update mock data

- Phase 5 (Frontend - App Structure): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-4-backend-functions]
  - Configure Vite for development
  - Wrap app with ConvexProvider configured for self-hosted URL
  - Set up React Router for two-page navigation

- Phase 6 (Frontend - View Page): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-5-frontend-structure]
  - Create ViewPage component with useQuery hook for real-time data

- Phase 7 (Frontend - Update Page): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-6-frontend-view]
  - Create UpdatePage component with form and useMutation hook

- Phase 8 (Integration - Scripts): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-7-frontend-update, phase-2-infrastructure]
  - Create admin key generation shell script wrapper
  - Create data seeding npm script
  - Add npm scripts for deployment and admin operations

- Phase 9 (Documentation): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-8-integration-scripts]
  - Write README with architecture diagram and deployment instructions

Services Involved:
- react-frontend: Vite-based React app with Convex React SDK, runs on port 5173
- convex-backend: Self-hosted Convex database in Docker, runs on port 3210
- infrastructure: Docker Compose + Python deployment scripts

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups:
  * Phase 2 (Infrastructure Setup) and Phase 3 (Backend Schema) can run in parallel (both depend only on Phase 1, no file conflicts)
- Sequential execution recommended due to tight dependencies between most phases

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: high
- Test Types Required: unit, integration, e2e
- Security Scanning: Not required (no auth/sensitive data)
- Staging Deployment: Not required (local development environment)

QA Acceptance Criteria:
- Unit tests: npm test for React components
- Integration tests: Frontend to Backend WebSocket connection
- E2E tests: Real-time sync verification across browsers
- Browser verification: View and Update pages render correctly
- Database verification: Convex running and data seeded

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 003 --parallel 1

Example:
  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 003 --parallel 1
